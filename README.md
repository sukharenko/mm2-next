- 📊 **Rich flight data** from FlightAware API (routes, times, gates, terminals)
- 🗺️ **Interactive Google Maps** with aircraft markers and trajectories
- ✈️ **Detailed aircraft info** from ADS-B DB (photos, registration, airline)
- 🌍 **100+ countries** with ICAO address lookup and flag emojis
- 📈 **Real-time updates** via WebSocket connection
- 🎯 **Flight progress tracking** with visual progress bars
- 🏢 **Airline logos** for professional appearance
